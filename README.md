This repository is a template for building a RESTful API in Go (Golang) using the Echo Framework. It includes request validation using the Validator package and integrates various middleware using Echo Middleware v4. You can use this as a starting point for your own API projects or as a learning resource for Echo and Golang newcomers.

## Features

- A sample RESTful API built with the Echo Framework in Golang.
- Request validation using the Validator package.
- Various middleware options for request processing.
- A well-organized project structure.
- Configuration setup for environment-specific settings.
- Example API endpoints.
